# funfit
A package for fitting numerically simulated functional response models to experimental data.


## Acknowledgements
I used many different internet sources and build upon existing R-packages and scientific
publications to develop this package. I am grateful that so many people published
help I could use. I will list my sources below:

- Using Roxygen2 with Rcpp: Post on \href{R-bloggers}{https://www.r-bloggers.com/2016/08/rcpp-and-roxygen2/} by Brandon Bertelsen.

- I had some issue with building installing from a runing R session, so thanks to that \href{post}{https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6313079/quit-and-restart-a-clean-r-session-from-within-r} restarting R was easier.
